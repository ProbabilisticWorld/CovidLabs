# Physics labs at home

Due the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, we needed to move all instruction online---including all physics labs. For the term affected, I'm teaching Introduction to Physics (Phys 110), a one-quarter class that falls somewhere between a purely conceptual class and a College Physics/algebra-based physics class; and Engineering Physics III (Phys 256), the third quarter of a University Physics/calculus-based physics class.

For Phys 110, my focus is to create labs using a combination of online simulations, and materials that they should be able to find around the home. I think these labs could be adapted pretty easily for a College Physics course.

I will update this page as I create more labs.

<!---Phys 110--->
# Introduction to Physics (Phys 110)
* [Fun with Physics][funwithphys] (pdf)
  * This is the lab I do in the first week of class. It introduces students to a variety of demonstrations that come up throughout the course.

* [Measuring motion][measmot] (docx)
  * I use a couple of [PhET][PhET] simulations, as well as have students take and graph their own data using a stopwatch and tape measure.

* [Alternate measuring motion][measmotalt] (docx)
  * Many students were having difficulty running the java applications from the old PhET simulations. This version uses html5 interactives from [The Physics Classroom][tpc].

* [Collisions][momentum] (docx)
  * Students use the PhET [collision simulation][PhETcoll] to investigate differneces between elastic and inelastic collisions. They then release a ball from rest, measure it's release height and bounce height, and determine if the collision between the ball and the ground is elastic or inelastic.

* [Ballistic pendulum][ballpend] (docx)
  * This lab uses a [simulation][geogebrasim] from [Geogebra][geogebra] for a fairly traditional ballistic pendulum experiment.
  * After that, they look at another system requiring analysis of both energy and momentum: an [M&M shot through a soda can][mnm]. This video is from the [Science Education Resource Center at Carlton College][serc].
  * The post-lab questions emphasise the fact that these are *inelastic* collisions; I find it is a common mistake to say the intial kinetic energy of the bullet of a ballistic pendulum is equal to the final gravitational potential energy of the system.

* [Elasticity][elasticity] (docx)
  * When meeting in person, I run a lab where they find the spring constant of plastic cutlery (inspired by a lab by [Wendy Adams][adamslabs] at Colorado School of Mines). This at-home lab follows the same process.
  * This lab uses a the [Mass and Springs PhET][PhETspring] to get some "nice" data
  * They also use a "springy" household object for some real data.
  * The students need to come up with their own set of calibrated weights for applying force; some tips are given in the lab handout. I think this is a really neat way to show students that they don't need special equipment to do physics!

* [Circular motion][pig] (docx)
  * This uses two videos of a flying pig demonstration. Videos were taken by our lab technician.
  * [Video 1][pig1]
  * [Video 2][pig2]

<!---Phys 256--->
# Engineering Physics III (Phys 256)
For this class, my labs are more open-ended, requiring the students design their own experiments. This is how I structure my Phys 25x labs even when we're not forced to do labs remotely. I have more information on that [here][CYOALabs].

* [Gas Properties][gasprop] (docx)
  * Adapted from the lab posted by Andrew Young to the AAPT-CPTYC [shared labs][AAPTsharedlabs] page. I don't know the license Dr. Young's lab is released under, so it may not fall under the creative commons license listed below.
  * Uses the [Gas Properties PhET][PhETgas]

* [Specific heat][specheat] (docx)
  * Uses a [simulation][specheatsim] from [William J. Vining][vining] in the chemistry department of SUNY Oneonta
  * Also has students use water to determine the power output of their stove

* [Pendulum Periods][pendper] (docx)
  * The beauty of a simple pendulum is that it's so simple! In this lab, students investigate relationships between the mass, length, and amplitude of a simple pendulum.
  * This lab is more extensive than some of the others, so I give them two weeks to work on it. After the first week, I have them do a short check-in to help keep them on trak (and not put it off entirely to the last minute)

* [Standing waves][stwaves] (docx)
  * Uses a video that Glenda Denicolo [shared][Denicolo] with the [AAPT-CPTYC][AAPTsharedlabs].
  * I describe this lab to my students like "seeing through the eyes" of an experimenter. Students make all measurements based on what they can see in the video.

* [Sound][sound] (docx)
  * This is an investigation of different sounds, how different sounds relate to each other (with beats and musical intervals), using the program [Audacity][audacityteam].
  * Some tones are generated in Audacity. Others are the following ogg files:
    * [Trombone][bone]
    * [Trumpet][tpt]
    * [Tenor sax][tenor]
    * [Drum][drum]
  * This lab is adapted from a [similar lab][Jensen] that Erik Jensen from Chemeketa Community College shared with the [AAPT-CPTYC][AAPTsharedlabs].
  * In accordance with Jensen's lab, my lab is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0). My four linked ogg files are licensted under the CC-BY-NC-SA license listed below.

* [Transmittance][transmittance] (docx)
  * This lab uses the [Bending Light PhET][snellphet] to look at the intensity of transmitted light as a function of incident angle and index of refraction
  * The simulation does not include polarization, so the students won't really find the "right" relationship; the point of the lab is to think about how we define mathematical relationships, and how an experimenter uses multiple data sets to draw conclusions.
