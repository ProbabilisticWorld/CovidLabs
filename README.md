# Physics labs at home

Due the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, we needed to move all instruction online---including all physics labs. For the term affected, I'm teaching Introduction to Physics (Phys 110), a one-quarter class that falls somehwere between a purely conceptual class and a College Physics/algebra-based physics class; and Engineering Physics III (Phys 256), the third quarter of a University Physics/calculus-based physics class.

For Phys 110, my focus is to create labs using a combination of online simulations, and materials that they should be able to find around the home.

I will update this page as I create more labs.
