# Physics labs at home

Due the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, we needed to move all instruction online---including all physics labs. For the term affected, I'm teaching Introduction to Physics (Phys 110), a one-quarter class that falls somehwere between a purely conceptual class and a College Physics/algebra-based physics class; and Engineering Physics III (Phys 256), the third quarter of a University Physics/calculus-based physics class.

For Phys 110, my focus is to create labs using a combination of online simulations, and materials that they should be able to find around the home.

I will update this page as I create more labs.

# Introduction to Physics (Phys 110)
* [Fun with Physics][funwithphys] (pdf)
	* This is the lab I do in the first week of class. It introduces students to a variety of demonstrations that come up throughout the course.
* [Measuring motion][measmot] (docx)
	* I use a couple of [PhET][PhET] simulations, as well as have students take and graph their own data using a stopwatch and tape measure.
