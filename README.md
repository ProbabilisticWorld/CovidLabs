# Physics labs at home

Due the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, we needed to move all instruction online---including all physics labs. For the term affected, I'm teaching Introduction to Physics (Phys 110), a one-quarter class that falls somehwere between a purely conceptual class and a College Physics/algebra-based physics class; and Engineering Physics III (Phys 256), the third quarter of a University Physics/calculus-based physics class.

For Phys 110, my focus is to create labs using a combination of online simulations, and materials that they should be able to find around the home. I think these labs could be adapted pretty easily for a College Physics course.

I will update this page as I create more labs.

<!---Phys 110--->
# Introduction to Physics (Phys 110)
* [Fun with Physics][funwithphys] (pdf)
	* This is the lab I do in the first week of class. It introduces students to a variety of demonstrations that come up throughout the course.
	
* [Measuring motion][measmot] (docx)
	* I use a couple of [PhET][PhET] simulations, as well as have students take and graph their own data using a stopwatch and tape measure.

* [Alternate measuring motion][measmotalt] (docx)
	* Many students were having difficulty running the java applications from the old PhET simulations. This version uses html5 interactives from [The Physics Classroom][tpc].
	
* [Collisions][momentum] (docx)
	* Students use the PhET [collision simulation][PhETcoll] to investigate differneces between elastic and inelastic collisions. They then release a ball from rest, measure it's release height and bounce height, and determine if the collision between the ball and the ground is elastic or inelastic.

* [Ballistic pendulum][ballpend] (docx)
	* This lab uses a [simulation][geogebrasim] from [Geogebra][geogebra] for a fairly traditional ballistic pendulum experiment.
	* After that, they look at another system requiring analysis of both energy and momentum: an [M&M shot through a soda can][mnm]. This video is from the [Science Education Resource Center at Carlton College][serc].
	* The post-lab questions emphasise the fact that these are *inelastic* collisions; I find it is a common mistake to say the intial kinetic energy of the bullet of a ballistic pendulum is equal to the final gravitational potential energy of the system.

<!---Phys 256--->
# Engineering Physics III (Phys 256)
For this class, my labs are more open-ended, requiring the students design their own experiments. This is how I structure my Phys 25x labs even when we're not forced to do labs remotely. I have more information on that [here][CYOALabs].

* [Gas Properties][gasprop] (docx)
	* Adapted from the lab posted by Andrew Young to the AAPT-CPTYC [shared labs][AAPTsharedlabs] page. I don't know the license Dr. Young's lab is released under, so it may not fall under the creative commons license listed below.
	* Uses the [Gas Properties PhET][PhETgas]
* [Specific heat][specheat] (docx)
	* Uses a [simulation][specheatsim] from [William J. Vining][vining] in the chemistry department of SUNY Oneonta
	* Also has students use water to determine the power output of their stove

* [Pendulum Periods][pendper] (docx)
	* The beauty of a simple pendulum is that it's so simple! In this lab, students investigate relationships between the mass, length, and amplitude of a simple pendulum.
	* This lab is more extensive than some of the others, so I give them two weeks to work on it. After the first week, I have them do a short check-in to help keep them on trak (and not put it off entirely to the last minute)
