# Physics labs at home

Due the 2020 covid-19 pandemic, we needed to move all instruction online---including all physics labs. For the term affected, I'm teaching Introduction to Physics (Phys 110), a one-quarter class that falls somehwere between a purely conceptual class and a College Physics/algebra-based physics class; and Engineering Physics III (Phys 256), the third quarter of a University Physics/calculus-based physics class.

For Phys 110, my focus is to create labs using a combination of online simulations, and materials that they should be able to find around the home. I think these labs could be adapted pretty easily for a College Physics course.

I will update this page as I create more labs.

# Introduction to Physics (Phys 110)
* [Fun with Physics][funwithphys] (pdf)
	* This is the lab I do in the first week of class. It introduces students to a variety of demonstrations that come up throughout the course.
* [Measuring motion][measmot] (docx)
	* I use a couple of [PhET][PhET] simulations, as well as have students take and graph their own data using a stopwatch and tape measure.
* [Collisions][momentum] (docx)
	* Students use the PhET [collision simulation][PhETcoll] to investigate differneces between elastic and inelastic collisions. They then release a ball from rest, measure it's release height and bounce height, and determine if the collision between the ball and the ground is elastic or inelastic.

# Engineering Physics III (Phys 256)
For this class, my labs are more open-ended, requiring the students design their own experiments. This is how I structure my Phys 25x labs even when we're not forced to do labs remotely. I have more information on that [here][CYOALabs].

* [Gas Properties][gasprop] (docx)
	* Adapted from the lab posted by Andrew Young to the AAPT-CPTYC [shared labs][AAPTsharedlabs] page.
	* Uses the [Gas Properties PhET][PhETgas]
* [Specific heat][specheat] (docx)
	* Uses a [simulation][specheatsim] from [William J. Vining][vining] in the chemistry department of SUNY Oneonta
	* Also has students use water to determine the power output of their stove
